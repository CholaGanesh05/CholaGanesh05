# 🚀 AI & Software Engineering Portfolio  
### Student | Deep Learning | LLMs | Computer Vision | Social Network Analytics | Software Development

Hi there!  
I’m a student passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, and Social Network Analytics. I love building projects in  
- Deep Learning (Computer Vision, NLP, LLMs)  
- Graph / Social-Network Analytics & Graph ML  
- Full-stack Software & Systems Engineering  
- Computer Networks & Distributed Systems  

This repository collects my best work so far — ideal for internships, placements, and starting a strong career in AI / ML / Software Engineering.

## 📚 Learning Roadmaps (Growth & Continuity)

- Deep Learning & Neural Networks — from basics to advanced  
- NLP & LLMs — from classification to fine-tuning & RAG pipelines  
- Computer Vision — classification, detection, generation  
- Graph ML & Social Network Analytics — embeddings, GNNs, link prediction  
- Software Engineering & Systems — APIs, microservices, clean architecture  
- Computer Networks & Distributed Systems — fundamentals + system design  

---

## 🏆 Achievements & Learning Highlights

- Built 5+ complete AI / ML / CV / Graph-ML projects end-to-end  
- Practical experience in building pipelines — data → preprocessing → model → evaluation → deployment-ready  
- Familiarity with both AI and Software Engineering workflows — bridging the gap  
- Strong understanding of foundational data structures, algorithms, and system-level thinking

## 🚀 Roadmap & Future Work

* [ ] Add Graph Transformer-based projects (e.g. GraphSAGE, GAT)
* [ ] Build multi-modal projects (Vision + Text, e.g. image captioning or VQA)
* [ ] Develop LLM retrieval / RAG pipelines + small demo / app
* [ ] Add distributed-training / scalable pipelines / MLOps setups
* [ ] Expand Software Engineering projects — microservices, REST APIs, back-end systems

## ✨ Why This Portfolio Stands Out

* Balanced mix of AI / ML / DL + Software Engineering + Graph ML — shows versatility
* Clean structure, easy to navigate — recruiter & interviewer friendly
* Real projects, end-to-end pipelines — not just toy code
* Ready for placements, internships, and first professional roles

Thanks for visiting!
Feel free to dive into any project, use code, build upon it — and I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, or discussion.

If you like — I can also **generate a `requirements.txt` template** (with typical dependencies for these kinds of projects), and even optionally a **.gitignore** template.
